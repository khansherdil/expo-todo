# expo-todo
A fairly fancy todo application written in React Native Expo and Typescript

#### Explained

Fairly simple todo application to deepen my knowledge in Redux (with Typescript preferably). 
Todos are stored in a redux store and AsyncStorage, you can add, edit, delete todos.

#### Tech stack

1. Typescript
2. React Native (Expo)
3. Redux Toolkit (still working on fully typing the reducers)
4. momentjs
5. RNC/Datetimepicker


#### Images: TODO
